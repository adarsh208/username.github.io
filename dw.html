        <p class="font1">Diwali is connected to various religious events, deities and personalities, such as being the
            day Rama returned to his kingdom in Ayodhya with his wife Sita and his brother Lakshmana after defeating the
            demon king Ravana.[15] It is also widely associated with Lakshmi, the goddess of prosperity, and Ganesha,
            the god of wisdom and the remover of obstacles.[16] Other regional traditions connect the holiday to Vishnu,
            Krishna, Durga, Shiva, Kali, Hanuman, Kubera, Yama, Yami, Dhanvantari, or Vishvakarman.

            Primarily a Hindu festival, variations of Diwali are also celebrated by adherents of other faiths.[13] The
            Jains observe their own Diwali which marks the final liberation of Mahavira.[17][18] The Sikhs celebrate
            Bandi Chhor Divas to mark the release of Guru Hargobind from a Mughal prison.[19] Newar Buddhists, unlike
            other Buddhists, celebrate Diwali by worshipping Lakshmi, while the Hindus of Eastern India and Bangladesh
            generally celebrate Diwali by worshipping the goddess Kali.[20][2][21]

            During the festival, the celebrants illuminate their homes, temples and workspaces with diyas (oil lamps),
            candles and lanterns.[8] Hindus, in particular, have a ritual oil bath at dawn on each day of the
            festival.[22] Diwali is also marked with fireworks as well as the decoration of floors with rangoli designs
            and other parts of the house with jhalars. Food is a major focus with families partaking in feasts and
            sharing mithai.[23] The festival is an annual homecoming and bonding period not only for families,[15][16]
            but also for communities and associations, particularly those in urban areas, which will organise
            activities, events, and gatherings.[24][25] Many towns organise community parades and fairs with parades or
            music and dance performances in parks.[26] Some Hindus, Jains, and Sikhs will send Diwali greeting cards to
            family near and far during the festive season, occasionally with boxes of Indian confectionery.[26] Another
            aspect of the festival is remembering the ancestors.[27]

            Diwali is also a major cultural event for the Hindu, Sikh, and Jain diaspora.[28][29][30] The main day of
            the festival of Diwali (the day of Lakshmi Puja) is an official holiday in Fiji,[31] Guyana,[32] India,
            Malaysia,[b][33] Mauritius, Myanmar,[34] Nepal,[35] Pakistan,[36] Singapore,[37] Sri Lanka, Suriname, and
            Trinidad and Tobago.[38] </p>

        <p class="font1">Diwali was also described by numerous travelers from outside India. In his 11th-century memoir
            on India, the Persian traveler and historian Al Biruni wrote of Deepavali being celebrated by Hindus on the
            day of the New Moon in the month of Kartika.[55] The Venetian merchant and traveler Niccol√≤ de' Conti
            visited India in the early 15th-century and wrote in his memoir, "on another of these festivals they fix up
            within their temples, and on the outside of the roofs, an innumerable number of oil lamps... which are kept
            burning day and night" and that the families would gather, "clothe themselves in new garments", sing, dance,
            and feast.[56][57] The 16th-century Portuguese traveler Domingo Paes wrote of his visit to the Hindu
            Vijayanagara Empire, where Dipavali was celebrated in October with householders illuminating their homes,
            and their temples, with lamps.[57] It is mentioned in the Ramayana that Diwali was celebrated for only 2
            years in Ayodhya.[58]

            Islamic historians of the Delhi Sultanate and the Mughal Empire era also mentioned Diwali and other Hindu
            festivals. A few, notably the Mughal emperor Akbar, welcomed and participated in the festivities,[59][60]
            whereas others banned such festivals as Diwali and Holi, as Aurangzeb did in 1665.[61][62][e][f]

            Publications from the British colonial era also made mention of Diwali, such as the note on Hindu festivals
            published in 1799 by Sir William Jones, a philologist known for his early observations on Sanskrit and
            Indo-European languages.[65] In his paper on The Lunar Year of the Hindus, Jones, then based in Bengal,
            noted four of the five days of Diwali in the autumn months of Aswina-Cartica [sic] as the following:
            Bhutachaturdasi Yamaterpanam (2nd day), Lacshmipuja dipanwita (the day of Diwali), Dyuta pratipat Belipuja
            (4th day), and Bhratri dwitiya (5th day). The Lacshmipuja dipanwita, remarked Jones, was a "great festival
            at night, in honour of Lakshmi, with illuminations on trees and houses".[65][g]

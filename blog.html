        <p class="font1">India's population in 2021 as per World Bank is 1.39 billion.[1] Being the world's most
            populous country and one of its fastest-growing economies, India experiences both challenges and
            opportunities in context of public health. India is a hub for pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries;
            world-class scientists, clinical trials and hospitals yet country faces daunting public health challenges
            like child undernutrition, high rates of neonatal and maternal mortality, growth in noncommunicable
            diseases, high rates of road traffic accidents and other health related issues.

            The Human Rights Measurement Initiative[2] finds that India is fulfilling 80.5% of what it should be
            fulfilling for the right to health based on its level of income.[3] When looking at the right to health with
            respect to children, India achieves 92.1% of what is expected based on its current income.[3] In regards to
            the right to health amongst the adult population, the country achieves only 85.6% of what is expected based
            on the nation's level of income.[3] India falls into the "very bad" category when evaluating the right to
            reproductive health because the nation is fulfilling only 63.7% of what the nation is expected to achieve
            based on the resources (income) it has available </p>

        <p class="font1">Dentistry, also known as dental medicine and oral medicine, is the branch of medicine focused
            on the teeth, gums, and mouth. It consists of the study, diagnosis, prevention, management, and treatment of
            diseases, disorders, and conditions of the mouth, most commonly focused on dentition (the development and
            arrangement of teeth) as well as the oral mucosa.[2] Dentistry may also encompass other aspects of the
            craniofacial complex including the temporomandibular joint. The practitioner is called a dentist.

            The history of dentistry is almost as ancient as the history of humanity and civilization, with the earliest
            evidence dating from 7000 BC to 5500 BC.[3] Dentistry is thought to have been the first specialization in
            medicine which has gone on to develop its own accredited degree with its own specializations.[4] Dentistry
            is often also understood to subsume the now largely defunct medical specialty of stomatology (the study of
            the mouth and its disorders and diseases) for which reason the two terms are used interchangeably in certain
            regions. However, some specialties such as oral and maxillofacial surgery (facial reconstruction) may
            require both medical and dental degrees to accomplish. In European history, dentistry is considered to have
            stemmed from the trade of barber surgeons.[5]

            Dental treatments are carried out by a dental team, which often consists of a dentist and dental auxiliaries
            (such as dental assistants, dental hygienists, dental technicians, and dental therapists). Most dentists
            either work in private practices (primary care), dental hospitals, or (secondary care) institutions
            (prisons, armed forces bases, etc.).

            The modern movement of evidence-based dentistry calls for the use of high-quality scientific research and
            evidence to guide decision-making such as in manual tooth conservation, use of fluoride water treatment and
            fluoride toothpaste, dealing with oral diseases such as tooth decay and periodontitis, as well as systematic
            diseases such as osteoporosis, diabetes, celiac disease, cancer, and HIV/AIDS which could also affect the
            oral cavity. Other practices relevant to evidence-based dentistry include radiology of the mouth to inspect
            teeth deformity or oral malaises, haematology (study of blood) to avoid bleeding complications during dental
            surgery, cardiology (due to various severe complications arising from dental surgery with patients with
            heart disease), etc.

            Terminology
            The term dentistry comes from dentist, which comes from French dentiste, which comes from the French and
            Latin words for tooth.[6] The term for the associated scientific study of teeth is odontology (from Ancient
            Greek: ὀδούς, romanized: odoús, lit. 'tooth') – the study of the structure, development, and abnormalities
            of the teeth.

            Dental treatment
            Dentistry usually encompasses practices related to the oral cavity.[7] According to the World Health
            Organization, oral diseases are major public health problems due to their high incidence and prevalence
            across the globe, with the disadvantaged affected more than other socio-economic groups.[8]

            The majority of dental treatments are carried out to prevent or treat the two most common oral diseases
            which are dental caries (tooth decay) and periodontal disease (gum disease or pyorrhea). Common treatments
            involve the restoration of teeth, extraction or surgical removal of teeth, scaling and root planing,
            endodontic root canal treatment, and cosmetic dentistry[9]

            By nature of their general training, dentists, without specialization can carry out the majority of dental
            treatments such as restorative (fillings, crowns, bridges), prosthetic (dentures), endodontic (root canal)
            therapy, periodontal (gum) therapy, and extraction of teeth, as well as performing examinations, radiographs
            (x-rays), and diagnosis. Dentists can also prescribe medications used in the field such as antibiotics,
            sedatives, and any other drugs used in patient management. Depending on their licensing boards, general
            dentists may be required to complete additional training to perform sedation, dental implants, etc.

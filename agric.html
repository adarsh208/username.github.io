        <p class="font1">India's population in 2021 as per World Bank is 1.39 billion.[1] Being the world's most
            populous country and one of its fastest-growing economies, India experiences both challenges and
            opportunities in context of public health. India is a hub for pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries;
            world-class scientists, clinical trials and hospitals yet country faces daunting public health challenges
            like child undernutrition, high rates of neonatal and maternal mortality, growth in noncommunicable
            diseases, high rates of road traffic accidents and other health related issues.

            The Human Rights Measurement Initiative[2] finds that India is fulfilling 80.5% of what it should be
            fulfilling for the right to health based on its level of income.[3] When looking at the right to health with
            respect to children, India achieves 92.1% of what is expected based on its current income.[3] In regards to
            the right to health amongst the adult population, the country achieves only 85.6% of what is expected based
            on the nation's level of income.[3] India falls into the "very bad" category when evaluating the right to
            reproductive health because the nation is fulfilling only 63.7% of what the nation is expected to achieve
            based on the resources (income) it has available </p>

        <p class="font1"> The history of agriculture in India dates back to the Neolithic period. India ranks second
            worldwide in farm outputs. As per the Indian economic survey 2020 -21, agriculture employed more than 50% of
            the Indian workforce and contributed 20.2% to the country's GDP.[1]

            In 2016, agriculture and allied sectors like animal husbandry, forestry and fisheries accounted for 17.5% of
            the GDP (gross domestic product) with about 41.49% of the workforce in 2020.[2][3][4][5] India ranks first
            in the world with highest net cropped area followed by US and China.[6] The economic contribution of
            agriculture to India's GDP is steadily declining with the country's broad-based economic growth. Still,
            agriculture is demographically the broadest economic sector and plays a significant role in the overall
            socio-economic fabric of India.

            The total agriculture commodities export was US$3.50 billion in March - June 2020. India exported $38
            billion worth of agricultural products in 2013, making it the seventh-largest agricultural exporter
            worldwide and the sixth largest net exporter.[7] Most of its agriculture exports serve developing and least
            developed nations.[7] Indian agricultural/horticultural and processed foods are exported to more than 120
            countries, primarily to the Japan, Southeast Asia, SAARC countries, the European Union and the United
            States.[8][9]

            Pesticides and fertilizers used in Indian agriculture have helped increase crop productivity, but their
            unregulated and excessive use has caused different ecosystem and fatal health problems.[10][11] Several
            studies published between 2011 and 2020 attribute 45 different types of cancers afflicting rural farm
            workers in India to pesticide usage. The chemicals have been shown to cause DNA damage, hormone disruption,
            and lead to a weakened immune system.[11] Occupational exposure to pesticides has been identified as a major
            trigger of the development of cancer.[11] The principal classes of pesticides investigated in relation to
            their role in intoxication and cancer were insecticides, herbicides, and fungicides.[12][11] Punjab, a state
            in India, utilises the highest amount of chemical fertilizers in the country. Many of the pesticides sprayed
            on the stateâ€™s crops are classified as class I by the World Health Organization because of their acute
            toxicity and are banned in places around the world, including Europe.[13][14]

        </p>
        <p class="font1"> Indian farmers are people who grow crops as a profession.[15] Various government estimates
            (Census, Agricultural Census, National Sample Survey assessments, and Periodic Labour Force Surveys) give a
            different number of farmers in the country ranging from 37 million to 118 million as per the different
            definitions.[16] Some definitions take in to account the number of holdings as compared to the number of
            farmers.[16] Other definitions take into account possession of land, while others try to delink land
            ownership from the definition of a farmer.[1

        <p class="font1">Internet, a system architecture that has revolutionized mass communication, mass media, and
            commerce by allowing various computer networks around the world to interconnect. Sometimes referred to as a
            “network of networks,” the Internet emerged in the United States in the 1970s but did not become visible to
            the general public until the early 1990s. By 2020, approximately 4.5 billion people, or more than half of
            the world’s population, were estimated to have access to the Internet. And that number is growing, largely
            due to the prevalence of “smart” technology and the "Internet of Things," where computer-like devices
            connect with the Internet or interact via wireless networks. These “things” include smartphones, appliances,
            thermostats, lighting systems, irrigation systems, security cameras. vehicles, even cities.

            The Internet provides a capability so powerful and general that it can be used for almost any purpose that
            depends on information, and it is accessible by every individual who connects to one of its constituent
            networks. It supports human communication via social media, electronic mail (e-mail), “chat rooms,”
            newsgroups, and audio and video transmission and allows people to work collaboratively at many different
            locations. It supports access to digital information by many applications, including the World Wide Web. The
            Internet has proved to be a spawning ground for a large and growing number of “e-businesses” (including
            subsidiaries of traditional “brick-and-mortar” companies) that carry out most of their sales and services
            over the Internet. </p>

        <p class="font1">The first computer networks were dedicated special-purpose systems such as SABRE (an airline
            reservation system) and AUTODIN I (a defense command-and-control system), both designed and implemented in
            the late 1950s and early 1960s. By the early 1960s computer manufacturers had begun to use semiconductor
            technology in commercial products, and both conventional batch-processing and time-sharing systems were in
            place in many large, technologically advanced companies. Time-sharing systems allowed a computer’s resources
            to be shared in rapid succession with multiple users, cycling through the queue of users so quickly that the
            computer appeared dedicated to each user’s tasks despite the existence of many others accessing the system
            “simultaneously.” This led to the notion of sharing computer resources (called host computers or simply
            hosts) over an entire network. Host-to-host interactions were envisioned, along with access to specialized
            resources (such as supercomputers and mass storage systems) and interactive access by remote users to the
            computational powers of time-sharing systems located elsewhere. These ideas were first realized in ARPANET,
            which established the first host-to-host network connection on October 29, 1969. It was created by the
            Advanced Research Projects Agency (ARPA) of the U.S. Department of Defense. ARPANET was one of the first
            general-purpose computer networks. It connected time-sharing computers at government-supported research
            sites, principally universities in the United States, and it soon became a critical piece of infrastructure
            for the computer science research community in the United States. Tools and applications—such as the simple
            mail transfer protocol (SMTP, commonly referred to as e-mail), for sending short messages, and the file
            transfer protocol (FTP), for longer transmissions—quickly emerged. In order to achieve cost-effective
            interactive communications between computers, which typically communicate in short bursts of data, ARPANET
            employed the new technology of packet switching. Packet switching takes large messages (or chunks of
            computer data) and breaks them into smaller, manageable pieces (known as packets) that can travel
            independently over any available circuit to the target destination, where the pieces are reassembled. Thus,
            unlike traditional voice communications, packet switching does not require a single dedicated circuit
            between each pair of users.DARPA (Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency; formerly ARPA) supported
            initiatives for ground-based and satellite-based packet networks. The ground-based packet radio system
            provided mobile access to computing resources, while the packet satellite network connected the United
            States with several European countries and enabled connections with widely dispersed and remote regions.
            With the introduction of packet radio, connecting a mobile terminal to a computer network became feasible.
            However, time-sharing systems were then still too large, unwieldy, and costly to be mobile or even to exist
            outside a climate-controlled computing environment. A strong motivation thus existed to connect the packet
            radio network to ARPANET in order to allow mobile users with simple terminals to access the time-sharing
            systems for which they had authorization. Similarly, the packet satellite network was used by DARPA to link
            the United States with satellite terminals serving the United Kingdom, Norway, Germany, and Italy. These
            terminals, however, had to be connected to other networks in European countries in order to reach the end
            users. Thus arose the need to connect the packet satellite net, as well as the packet radio net, with other
            networks.

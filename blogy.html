            History
            Main article: History of Indian foreign relations
            See also: Indus–Mesopotamia relations, Ancient Greece–Ancient India relations, Indo-Roman relations,
            Indo-Roman trade relations, and Indian maritime history
            India's relations with the world have evolved since the British Raj (1857–1947) when the British Empire took
            responsibility for handling external and defence relations. When India gained independence in 1947, few
            Indians had experience in making or conducting foreign policy. However, the country's oldest political
            party, the Indian National Congress, had established a small foreign department in 1925 to make overseas
            contacts and to publicise its independence struggle. From the late 1920s on, Jawaharlal Nehru, who had a
            long-standing interest in world affairs among independence leaders, formulated the Congress's stance on
            international issues in tandem with V. K. Krishna Menon; after 1947, they articulated India's worldview as
            Prime Minister and de facto Foreign Minister.

            India's international influence varied over the years after independence. Indian prestige and moral
            authority were high in the 1950s and facilitated the acquisition of developmental assistance from both East
            and West. Although the prestige stemmed from India's nonaligned stance, and in particular the position it
            placed Indian diplomats, like Menon, to mediate or conciliate in others' disputes, the nation was unable to
            prevent Cold War politics from becoming intertwined with interstate relations in South Asia. On the
            intensely debated Kashmir issue with Pakistan, India lost credibility by rejecting United Nations' calls for
            a plebiscite in the disputed area.[12]

            In the 1960s and 1970s, India's international position among developed and developing countries faded during
            wars with China and Pakistan, disputes with other countries in South Asia, and India's attempt to match
            Pakistan's support from the United States and China by signing the Indo-Soviet Treaty of Friendship and
            Cooperation in August 1971. Although India obtained substantial Soviet military and economic aid, which
            helped to strengthen the nation, India's influence was undercut regionally and internationally by the
            perception that its friendship with the Soviet Union prevented a more forthright condemnation of the Soviet
            presence in Afghanistan. In the late 1980s, India improved relations with the United States, other developed
            countries, and China while continuing close ties with the Soviet Union. Relations with its South Asian
            neighbours, especially Pakistan, Sri Lanka, and Nepal, occupied much of the energies of the Ministry of
            External Affairs.[13]

            Even before independence, the Indian colonial government maintained semi-autonomous diplomatic relations. It
            had colonies (such as the Aden Settlement), that sent and received full missions.[14] India was a founder
            member of both the League of Nations[15] and the United Nations.[16] After India gained independence from
            the United Kingdom in 1947, it soon joined the Commonwealth of Nations and strongly supported independence
            movements in other colonies, like the Indonesian National Revolution.[17] The partition and various
            territorial disputes, particularly that over Kashmir, would strain its relations with Pakistan for years to
            come. During the Cold War, India adopted a foreign policy of not aligning itself with any major power bloc.
            However, India developed close ties with the Soviet Union and received extensive military support from it.

            The end of the Cold War significantly affected India's foreign policy, as it did for much of the world. The
            country now seeks to strengthen its diplomatic and economic ties with the United States,[18][19] the
            European Union trading bloc,[20] Japan,[21] Israel,[22] Mexico,[23] and Brazil.[24] India has also forged
            close ties with the member states of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations,[25] the African Union,[26]
            the Arab League[27] and Iran.[28]

            Though India continues to have a military relationship with Russia,[29] Israel has emerged as India's
            second-largest military partner[26] while India has built a strong strategic partnership with the United
            States.[18][30] The foreign policy of Narendra Modi indicated a shift towards focusing on the Asian region
            and, more broadly, trade deals.

            Policy
            India's foreign policy has always regarded the concept of neighbourhood as one of widening concentric
            circles, around a central axis of historical and cultural commonalities.[31]

            As many as 44 million people of Indian origin live and work abroad and constitute an important link with the
            mother country. An important role of India's foreign policy has been to ensure their welfare and well-being
            within the framework of the laws of the country where they live.[32]

            Role of the Prime Minister
            Jawaharlal Nehru, India's first Prime Minister, promoted a strong personal role for the Prime Minister.
            Nehru served concurrently as Prime Minister and Minister of External Affairs; he made all major foreign
            policy decisions himself after consulting with his advisers and then entrusted the conduct of international
            affairs to senior members of the Indian Foreign Service. He was the main founding father of the Panchsheel
            or the Five Principles of Peaceful Co-existence.

            His successors continued to exercise considerable control over India's international dealings, although they
            appointed separate ministers of external affairs.[33][34][35]


            Jawaharlal Nehru, the 1st Prime Minister of India, addressing the United Nations (1948)
            India's second prime minister, Lal Bahadur Shastri (1964–66), expanded the Prime Minister's Office
            (sometimes called the Prime Minister's Secretariat) and enlarged its powers. By the 1970s, the Office of the
            Prime Minister had become the de facto coordinator and supra-ministry of the Indian government. The enhanced
            role of the office strengthened the prime minister's control over foreign policymaking at the expense of the
            Ministry of External Affairs. Advisers in the office provided channels of information and policy
            recommendations in addition to those offered by the Ministry of External Affairs. A subordinate part of the
            office—the Research and Analysis Wing (RAW)—functioned in ways that significantly expanded the information
            available to the prime minister and his advisers. The RAW gathered intelligence, provided intelligence
            analysis to the Office of the Prime Minister, and conducted covert operations abroad.

            The prime minister's control and reliance on personal advisers in the Office of the Prime Minister was
            particularly strong under the tenures of Indira Gandhi (1966–77 and 1980–84) and her son, Rajiv (1984–89),
            who succeeded her, and weaker during the periods of coalition governments. Observers find it difficult to
            determine whether the locus of decision-making authority on any issue lies with the Ministry of External
            Affairs, the Council of Ministers, the Office of the Prime Minister, or the prime minister himself.[36]

            The Prime Minister is however free to appoint advisers and special committees to examine various foreign
            policy options and areas of interest.[citation needed] In a recent instance, Manmohan Singh appointed K.
            Subrahmanyam in 2005 to head a special government task force to study 'Global Strategic Developments' over
            the next decade.[37] The Task Force submitted its conclusions to the Prime Minister in 2006.[38][39] The
            report has not yet been released in the public domain.


            Pranab Mukherjee, the former Finance Minister of India and former President of India with former US
            President George W. Bush in 2008.
            India's historical inclination towards a "non-aligned" foreign policy has witnessed a shift under Prime
            Minister Narendra Modi's leadership since 2014, as New Delhi has displayed a heightened level of
            "assertiveness" in its international engagements.[40]
